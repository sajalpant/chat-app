### CSS Styles

All the layouts are based on default UIkit styles to keep things clean and simple, but some layouts may use some custom css code.

The css styles are the minified latest version of UIKit 3 ( latest ) from the CDN.

### HTML
The code tries to be as simple as possible, with commented sections, <strong>validated and semantic</strong> html5 markup.

### JS

Since UIkit 3 removed JQuery dependency, it´s not included. All JS implementations are created by adding `data-uk-*` attributes to the HTML elements. No additional JS lines are added. 

The `uikit.min.js` file is the minified latest version of UIKit 3 ( latest ) from the CDN. 

The `data-uk-*` syntax it´s used in order to work with every library and get HTML code validated.
